<p><span style="font-size:22px;"><u><strong>Trash, yet somehow efficient proxy site that CNAME&#39;s forked repo&#39;s servers</strong></u></span></p>


<p><span style="font-size: 22px;">The former repo&#39;s owner ,(OuTeRsLoTh) has disbanded from this, and has transferred ownership of these proxies to @Rockpods</span></p>


'Atomic Bomb' Proxies is one of many proxy sites, going against great competitors! What makes us so different is the amount of experience and observation put into our proxies and sites. We plan to expand to bigger and better things! This code will always be free and open source, but credit is appreciated.

NEW THIS UPDATE:
1. Alloy Browser with cloak
2. Via unblocker(external) - not external coming soon
3. Rebranding to Atomic Bomb
4. Holy Unblocker cloak copy and paste

NEED TO DO:
1. Stop using template
2. Fix Via
3. Clean up Alloy Browser
4. Finish rebranding
5. Everyting... There are many more things to do but these are a few of the important ones

IDEAS:
1. Cock and ball torture secret page...
